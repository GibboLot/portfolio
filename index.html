                <p>
                    I am dedicated to learning more about coding and other subjects that challenge me. While Iâ€™m still exploring my interests, I believe this course will help me grow and find the right direction. Iâ€™m a hardworking person who also values having fun in whatever Iâ€™m doing â€” I believe in having a good balance in life, and I bring that mindset to everything I do. I am also a fast learner, once I understand something, I can quickly apply it to the subjects I study. One thing I enjoy is problem-solving â€” it feels like a brain exercise that challenges me every time I learn something new.

                I have basic knowledge of Python, HTML and CSS. Iâ€™m still in the learning process where I am getting into the deeper understanding of the coding languages. I also have the very basic knowledge of Arduino C++ from my NITEC studies in Mechatronics and Robotics, where I learned how to control objects from position to position. I'm new to HTML and CSS.

                From my leadership role as a Welfare Exco in the Network and Security Technology Club (NST), I developed leadership and teamwork skills by planning events and supporting the well-being of other club members. This experience taught me how to work closely with others, communicate clearly, and take charge of my duties. Also, during my 20-week internship as a Tech Support, I applied and strengthened these skills even further by assisting in troubleshooting software and hardware, maintaining IT equipment, and ensuring smooth operations.

                    It is my pleasure to write this testimonial in support of Oh QuanXiu, Jeremyâ€™s application for admission to polytechnic. As his teacher, I have found Jeremy to be a thoughtful and inquisitive learner with a genuine interest in technology and problem-solving.

                    Jeremy has demonstrated a strong curiosity for coding, particularly in areas such as Python, scripting, and web development. Outside of the classroom, he took the initiative to learn HTML on his own and applied his skills to build a personal portfolio website, which can be viewed <a href="https://portfolio-nine-red-81.vercel.app">here</a>. This proactive attitude highlights not only his passion for programming, but also his willingness to explore and apply new knowledge independently.

                    Jeremyâ€™s course choices are Common ICT, Applied AI and Analytics, and Computer Science. These are well aligned with his interests and strengths. His enjoyment of problem-solving, openness to exploring different tech pathways, and eagerness to learn new skills make him an ideal candidate for these programmes.

                    I fully support Jeremyâ€™s application and am confident that he will thrive in your institution. His initiative, curiosity, and strong foundation in both coding and analytical thinking make him a promising student with much potential. We wish him every success.
